# Simulated phenotype based on UK Biobank individuals

00-compile-data.ipynb

1. Subset a set of SNPs (overlap between hapmap3 and UK Biobank)
2. Use PLINK to subset SNPs by chromosomes.
3. Phenotype compilation (not used in simulation studies, but may be used in accompanied real data analyses)

01-simulate-pheno.ipynb
1. Simulate the phenotype with various genetic architecture.
